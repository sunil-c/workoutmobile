# Xrcsr - Workout Diary

## Overview
TLDR; your workout diary should be easy to use

Most gym workouts aren't complicated. You do an exercise for time or reps, you do a number of sets, and sometimes use a weight of some kind (e.g. dumbell, kettle bell, plate, bar, etc). An important part of building up your fitness and strength is keeping an accurate workout diary for each workout. Commonly this means keeping notes in a physical notepad or notes entered into an app (e.g. Evernote) on your phone. 

## Tech
This Xamarin app is based on the standard MasterDetail Page and a vanilla MVVM model. It enables a user to record, store and retrieve exercises performed on a specific date. The app stores info locally in a SQLlite database. Your data is not shared by default. Future enhancements will include creating a cloud storage location for backup.

## Dev environment
VS 2019. Xamarin and Xamarin Forms 4.x. Sqlite.
