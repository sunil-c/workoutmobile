# Xrcsr - Workout Diary

## Overview
TLDR; an easy to use workout diary 

Most gym workouts aren't complicated. You do an exercise for time or reps, you do a number of sets, and sometimes use a weight of some kind (e.g. dumbell, kettle bell, plate, bar, etc). An important part of building up your fitness and strength is keeping an accurate workout diary for each workout. Commonly this means keeping notes in a physical notepad or notes entered into an app (e.g. Evernote) on your phone. Xrcsr aims to make recording your workout as easy as it is with paper.

Xrcsr gives you a daily entry with dozens of exercises available. If you don't find your exercise you can add one to the list using the easy to use exercise maintenance page. Record new exercise sessions by adding a daily entry for the first exercise you do, then the next, and so forth.

## Tech
This Xamarin app is based on the standard MasterDetail Page and a vanilla MVVM model. It enables a user to record, store and retrieve exercises performed on a specific date. The app stores info locally in a SQLlite database. Your data is not shared by default. Future enhancements will include creating a cloud storage location for backup.
