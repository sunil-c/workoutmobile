# Xrcsr - Workout Diary

## Overview
TLDR; an easy to use workout diary 

Most gym workouts aren't complicated. You do an exercise for time or reps, you do a number of sets, and sometimes use a weight of some kind (e.g. dumbell, kettle bell, plate, bar, etc). An important part of building up your fitness and strength is keeping an accurate workout diary for each workout. Commonly means of doing thisinclude keeping notes in a physical notepad or entering the notes into an app (e.g. Evernote) on your phone. Xrcsr aims to make recording your workout on your phone as easy as it is with paper.

Xrcsr gives you the ability to store daily entries, with dozens of exercises available. If you don't find your exercise among those listed, you can add one to the list using the easy to use exercise maintenance page. Annotate exercise sessions by adding a note (e.g. "2 secs down 1 sec up"). 

Xrcsr's primary purpose is to get involved with Xamarin and mobile apps. The code is free to use.

## Tech
This Xamarin app is based on the standard MasterDetail Page and a vanilla MVVM model. It enables a user to record, store and retrieve exercises performed on a specific date. The app stores info locally in a SQLlite database. Your data is not shared by default. Future enhancements will include creating a cloud storage location for backup.
